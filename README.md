# VHDL Digital Logic Design Repository

Welcome to the **VHDL Digital Logic Design** repository. This repository documents my journey of learning and implementing digital logic circuits using VHDL. The focus is on designing basic combinational logic circuits, with plans to expand into more advanced designs as I progress.

## Projects Included

### 1. Combinational Logic Circuits
   - **Multiplexer**
   - **Decoder**
   - **Adder**
   - More to come...

Each design is accompanied by:
   - VHDL code
   - Testbenches to validate functionality

## Learning Objectives
This repository is aimed at:
   - Developing a solid understanding of VHDL for digital logic design
   - Implementing and simulating combinational logic circuits
   - Building a resource for beginners to learn from simple VHDL designs

## How to Use This Repository
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/VHDL-digital_logic_design.git
